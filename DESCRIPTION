Description: Takes two untargeted metabolomics feature lists (consisting of m/z,
  rt, and sample intensity measurements, plus optional identifiers, adduct 
	labels, and extras) and outputs a merged feature list consisting of potential 
	compound matches, ranked by a similarity score for groups of features. Inputs 
	tables are assumed to be derived from biologically similar samples analyzed 
	with a similar analytical method.
